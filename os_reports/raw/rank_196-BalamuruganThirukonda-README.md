# 🧪 PXR ADMET pEC50 Prediction Challenge

This repository contains a machine learning pipeline for predicting **pEC50 values** of small molecules targeting the **Pregnane X Receptor (PXR)** using chemical structure (SMILES) and assay-derived features.

The solution combines:
- RDKit molecular descriptors
- Multiple chemical fingerprints
- Assay aggregation features
- Gradient boosting models (LightGBM)
- Cross-validation + ensemble prediction strategy

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Given a molecule represented as a **SMILES string**, predict its **pEC50 (potency value)** for PXR activity.

The dataset includes:
- Train set with known pEC50 values
- Test set for prediction submission
- Auxiliary assay data:
  - Single concentration assay
  - Counter assay measurements

---

## 🧠 Approach Overview

We build a hybrid model combining:

### 1. Chemical Representation
- Morgan Fingerprints (ECFP-like)
- RDKit path fingerprints
- MACCS keys
- Physicochemical descriptors (MW, LogP, TPSA, etc.)
- Structural features (rings, rotatable bonds, heteroatoms)
- E-state indices
- Functional group flags (e.g., nitro group)

### 2. Assay-Derived Features
- Single concentration response aggregation
- Counter assay potency (pEC50, Emax, baseline response)
- Dose-response statistics (mean, std, monotonicity, range)
- Missingness indicators

### 3. Feature Engineering
Key engineered signals:
- Dose-response ratios
- Effect strength
- Assay consistency metrics
- Confidence scores (t-statistic × FDR signal)
- Potency × assay interaction terms

## 🏗 Model Architecture

Two LightGBM regression models:

### Model A — Chemistry Only
Uses only SMILES-derived molecular features.

### Model B — Chemistry + Assay Features
Adds biological assay-derived signals.

### Final Prediction Strategy
if assay data available:
use Model B
else:
use Model A


---

## 🔁 Training Strategy

- 5-Fold Cross Validation (KFold, shuffled)
- LightGBM Regressors:
  - Model A: moderate complexity
  - Model B: higher capacity + regularization
- Ensemble evaluation via OOF predictions
- Ablation study comparing:
  - Model A
  - Model B
  - Weighted ensemble

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

Primary metric:
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**

Secondary metric:
- **R² score**

Additional analyses:
- Error distribution by assay availability
- Worst-case prediction analysis
- Feature importance ranking
